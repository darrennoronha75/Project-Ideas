This can be a simple Plugin/Extension/Website that combines or allows the user to use multiple AI tools from a single interface.
Our approach to build this is via freely available developer APIs for each AI application.

An additional thing we can introduce here - Self Awareness of the AI to suggest better prompts or more ideas for outputs.
We can require a general sense of 'intention' to use the application - ie - To Construct, to Code, to Correct Grammar

Problems to solve
- Managing Multiple Logins to various apps for end user (if we are not providing the services ourselves)
- Combination of multiple AI outputs
- Building the interface to allow multiple output types
- Rate Limitations for the API (3 for chatgpt on free trial, per minute) - We can ignore this and just build the framework that enables this to happen.

### Functional Requirements
### Backend Service 1
### Backend service 2

### Frontend
A simple frontend in react similar to how ChatGPT Interface looks. You can use any UI framework you want, but I would recommend using tailwindcss.


https://www.brancher.ai/ - This is a tool that already allows people to combine tools and build apps - since apps serve repeat-use purposes - this is arguably a better end result.
We can try to copy tool - but another idea is to tailor the above solution to a specific use case
